        <p>- Deloitte</p>
        <p><span>What Is IT Outsourcing? </span></p>
        <p>
          IT outsourcing is the use of external service providers to effectively
          deliver IT-enabled business process, application service and
          infrastructure solutions for business outcomes.
        </p>
        <p><span>Why Companies Oursource </span></p>
        <p>
          One of the reasons why companies outsource their IT tasks is to get
          access to additional IT specialists with the experience and expertise
          needed. Finding them can be a challenging task for most businesses.
          The demand for highly qualified specialists experienced in complex
          technology has increased significantly in our country. As the demand
          is higher than the supply, the available specialists have increased
          their labour/service prices significantly too.
        </p>
        <p><span>Covid-19 Impact </span></p>
        <p>
          Even before Covid-19, constant spending growth on outsourcing IT
          services was observed as well, but the global pandemic led to rapid
          increases and cost saving became one of the major factors in
          outsourcing.
        </p>
        <p><span>IT budgets </span></p>
        <p>
          Even before Covid-19, constant spending growth on outsourcing IT
          services was observed as well, but the global pandemic led to rapid
          increases and cost saving became one of the major factors in
          outsourcing.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Deloitte, 70% of businesses have turned to an outsourcing
          partner for cost reduction in 2020. And the Outsource Accelerator
          suggests that labor costs themselves can be reduced by at least 70%.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, cost isn’t the only factor. 49% of companies state that
          freeing up resources to focus on core tasks is one of the leading
          benefits of outsourcing.
        </p>
        <p><span>Benefits of IT Outsourcing </span></p>
        <p>
          There are many proven advantages of IT outsourcing that our partner
          companies can benefit from. Here are just some of them.
        </p>
        <p><span>1. Cost Advantages</span></p>
        <p>
          It is one of the most obvious benefits that outsourcing can bring.
          Business is about making money, and the lower operational costs are,
          the more companies will be able to invest in their future development.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            Costs are saved thanks to the optimization of the following things.
          </span>
        </p>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨ Hourly rates</h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨ Equipment & infrastructure</h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨ Recruitment and hiring costs</h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨ Training</h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨ Taxes</h5>
        <p><span>2. Increased Efficiency & Innovation</span></p>
        <p>
          Outsourcing brings more additional resources into the project which
          results in faster work and, thanks to the introduction of effective
          practices and skills, increased efficiency of the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>3. Access to Skilled Resources & Staffing Flexibility</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          As was mentioned and proved, the demand for skilled IT specialists
          will grow. Fast. IT outsourcing is an option to get access to trained
          and experienced staff the moment the business needs them (especially
          for companies that have seasonal or cyclical demands).
        </p>
        <p><span> 4. Internal Staff Education</span></p>
        <p>
          One of the reasons for using our NTP's outsource staff might be that
          the in-house team doesn’t have the required knowledge and/or skills.
          Outsourcing (especially on-site) may result in improving in-house team
          qualification thanks to knowledge sharing and mentoring by IT company
          specialists.
        </p>
        <p><span> 5. Focus on Core Activities</span></p>
        <p>
          Working with our outsourced staff allows business owners to focus
          their activities on strategic things – planning, research, brand
          building, sales and marketing, business processes optimization, etc.
          Outsourcing also enables business owners to plan and execute more
          effective projects or, vice versa, experiment and find new and unusual
          solutions.
        </p>
        <p><span> 6. Operational Costs Control</span></p>
        <p>
          We are responsible for keeping control over the time & budget of the
          project (especially if it is project-based cooperation).
        </p>
        <p><span> 7. Continuity and Risk Management</span></p>
        <p>
          By ensuring continuity, NTP reduces the risk of employee turnover for
          its customers. Also, one key factor in any business is risk assessment
          and analysis. IT experts will plan and mitigate potential risks.
        </p>
        <p><span> 8. Project Management Simplification</span></p>
        <p>
          The success of the project depends a lot on the quality of project
          management and on how well business owners can organize the
          cooperation of the team. Outsourcing on a project-based model already
          includes project management.
        </p>
        <p><span> 9. Work Relationships Simplification</span></p>
        <p>
          Working with NTP is governed by an official agreement that makes the
          entire collaboration simpler and less risky.
