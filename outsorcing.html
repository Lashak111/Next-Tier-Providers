        <p><span>What Is IT Outsourcing? </span></p>
        <p>
          IT outsourcing is the use of external service providers to effectively
          deliver IT-enabled business process, application service and
          infrastructure solutions for business outcomes.
        </p>
        <p><span>Why Companies Oursource </span></p>
        <p>
          One of the reasons why companies outsource their IT tasks is to get
          access to additional IT specialists with the experience and expertise
          needed. Finding them can be a challenging task for most businesses.
          The demand for new specialists experienced in complicated technology
          is considerably increased in our country. As the demand is higher than
          the supply, the available specialists increased their labour/service
          prices significantly too.
        </p>
        <p><span>Covid-19 Impact </span></p>
        <p>
          Covid-19 is an event that changed a lot of lives and businesses. It
          has influenced the outsourcing sphere and brought new IT outsourcing
          trends. Due to, Covid-19 in 2020, many businesses have started to use
          remote work.
        </p>
        <p><span>IT budgets </span></p>
        <p>
          Even before Covid-19, constant spending growth on outsourcing IT
          services was observed as well, but the global pandemic led to rapid
          increases and cost saving became one of the major factors in
          outsourcing.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Deloitte, 70% of businesses turned to an outsourcing
          partner for cost reduction in 2020. And Outsource Accelerator suggests
          that labor costs themselves can be reduced by at least 70%.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, cost isn’t the only factor. 49% of companies state that
          freeing up resources to focus on core tasks is one of the leading
          factors supporting outsourcing.
        </p>
        <p><span>Benefits of IT Outsourcing </span></p>
        <p>
          There are many proven strong sides of IT outsourcing that our partner
          companies can benefit from. Here are just some of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Cost Advantages It is one of the most obvious benefits that
          outsourcing may bring. Business is done for making money and the less
          operational costs are, the more companies will be able to invest in
          its future development.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>
            Costs are saved thanks to the optimization of the following things.
          </span>
        </p>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨Hourly rates</h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨Equipment & infrastructure</h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨Recruitment and hiring costs</h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨Training</h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">⇨Taxes</h5>
        <p>
          2. Increased Efficiency & Innovation Outsourcing brings new additional
          resources into the project which results in faster work and, thanks to
          the introduction of effective practices and skills, increased
          efficiency of the team. In fact, it has become the main reason for
          outsourcing, which is now called disruptive outsourcing.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Access to Skilled Resources & Staffing Flexibility As was mentioned
          and proved, the demand for skilled IT specialists will grow. Fast. IT
          outsourcing is an option to get access to trained and experienced
          staff the moment the business needs them (especially for companies
          that have seasonal or cyclical demands).
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Internal Staff Education One of the reasons for using our NTP's
          outsource staff might be that the in-house team doesn’t have the
          required knowledge and/or skills. Outsourcing (especially on-site) may
          result in improving in-house team qualification thanks to knowledge
          sharing and mentoring by the IT company specialists.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Focus on Core Activities Working with our outsource staff allows
          business owners to focus their activities on strategic things –
          planning, research, brand building, sales and marketing, business
          processes optimization, etc. Outsourcing also enables business owners
          to plan and execute more effective projects or, vice versa, experiment
          and find new unusual solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Operational Costs Control We are responsible for keeping control
          over the time & budget of the project (especially if it is
          project-based cooperation).
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Continuity and Risk Management NTP ensures a level of continuity
          for the customers to reduce the risk of employee turnover. Also, one
          important factor in any business is risk assessment and analysis. IT
          experts will plan and mitigate potential risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Project Management Simplification The success of the project
          depends a lot on the quality of project management and on how well
          business owners can organize the cooperation of the team. Outsourcing
          on a project-based model already includes project management.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Work Relationships Simplification Working with NTP is based on and
          regulated by an official agreement signed which makes the whole
          cooperation simpler and less risky.
