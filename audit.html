        <h2>IT Audit</h2>
        <p>
          <span> When was your last company check-up? </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern businesses are relying on their IT department now more than
          ever. Supporting and maintaining a functional and secure IT
          environment is already taking up the time of IT departments across the
          world. This is before a wave of upcoming challenges, advanced
          solutions with improved functionality, and a whole lot of new issues
          like security threats enter their environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having a stable and efficient network is very significant for business
          nowadays. That’s a well-known fact. But supporting and maintaining
          such a network can be very difficult. If a network problem occurs,
          fast and efficient troubleshooting is vital. Business owners and
          managers know that they can get better productivity from their staff
          if their IT is designed to deliver productivity and more importantly
          minimise downtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many may not even know there is a better way. This is where IT
          auditing comes in.
        </p>
        <p>
          For us, the first priority is to proactively maintain your systems and
          reduce the number and severity of problems in advance, then deal with
          problems that do arise later.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>What is IT audit, and why is it necessary?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide several types of IT auditing – from security to performance
          and compliance audits. The main objective of audits is to see whether
          there are any inaccuracies and inefficiencies in the management and
          use of the IT system of a business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the audit is completed, we recommend our consulting service,
          where our consultants make recommendations based on the world's best
          practices. These recommendations take into account how companies can
          avoid future threats and risks, protect their IT systems, valuable
          data and sensitive information. As a result of conducting
          comprehensive types of IT audits, companies can improve their IT
          environment and take advantage of the latest solutions. The most
          error-free, effective and productive use of IT systems for business.
        </p>
        <p><span>What is involved in an IT audit?</span></p>
        <p>
          IT auditing is undertaken for a number of reasons, often relating to
          performance, compliance, cost and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          During an audit, an IT specialist will assess a company’s
          infrastructure, policies and information. There are generally a number
          of different steps that will often vary depending on the nature and
          the needs of the business. Some of these include:
        </p>

        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          ⇨ Risk assessments for the many aspects of a company’s IT department
        </h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          • Identifying technology-related risks in an organisation, and
          creating recommendations specific to the business to mitigate these.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          • E.g. Chances are your network has developed gradually over time,
          with layers of hardware and software that may now be contributing to
          unintended security gaps or inefficiencies.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          ⇨ Assessing a business's readiness for new and upcoming technology in
          the market.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          • Technology is changing all the time, with new threats,
          vulnerabilities and opportunities for innovation constantly arising
        </h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          ⇨ Evaluating systems and applications to ensure they are secure,
          reliable and effective.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          • NTP IT consultants can conduct a comprehensive review of your IT
          environment and examine how your current technology is helping or
          hindering your business. You will receive a written evaluation of the
          key areas that need improvement.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          • This may also include evaluation of the use of these systems and
          applications.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          • To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the technology itself
          and the current use by employees.
        </h5>

        <p><span>Security risk assessments</span></p>

        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          • As your business relies more heavily on technology, the inherent
          risks increase as well. A single data breach or ransomware attack can
          cause huge financial, legal and reputational damage. Our comprehensive
          cybersecurity assessment identifies your level of risk and defines a
          mitigation approach to minimize and manage your threats and
          vulnerabilities.
        </h5>

        <h5 class="Auditspn">
          • Including the level of user training and other internal controls,
          vulnerabilities and whether there is an adequate and up-to-date
          security strategy.
