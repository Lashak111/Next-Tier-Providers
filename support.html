        <h2>Support & Maintenance</h2>
        <p>
          In an always-on world, many businesses never sleep and operate or
          provide services round-the-clock. For some, continuous service
          delivery is the reason for customer loyalty. However for any business,
          uptime and availability of critical resources play an influential role
          in determining the success of an organization. To ensure business
          continuity, organizations must overcome unique challenges every day.
          One of these challenges is downtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Downtime is disruptive, costly and unacceptable in today’s competitive
          business landscape. Downtime can happen for several reasons, ranging
          from accidental data deletion to application failure to advanced
          cyberattacks. Without a robust BCDR solution in place, an unplanned
          downtime event can result in costly consequences and tarnish your
          brand’s reputation.
        </p>
        <p><span> What Does Downtime Mean in Business? </span></p>
        <p>
          Downtime is a period during which production or business processes
          come to a halt due to application unavailability, technical glitch,
          network outage or natural disaster. During downtime, a computer
          system, server or network is offline or unavailable, and employees are
          involuntarily unproductive — unable to conduct business or service
          clients. Without a comprehensive business continuity plan, downtime
          can potentially paralyze your organization, and in some cases, even
          cause irreparable damage.
        </p>
        <p><span>⇨ Types of Downtime &#8678; </span></p>
        <p>
          Downtime can broadly be classified into planned downtime and unplanned
          downtime.
        </p>
        <p><span>⇨ Planned Downtime &#8678; </span></p>
        <p>This is where NTP maintenance service comes into play.</p>
        <p>
          Planned downtime is scheduled and anticipated in advance and may
          typically be carried out during holidays, weekends or after working
          hours. This ensures normal business operations are uninterrupted and
          employee productivity is unaffected. Planned downtime can be for
          routine maintenance or inspection, hardware/software upgrades, repairs
          or testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since planned downtime is intentional and controlled, it doesn’t have
          any negative impact on business when done right. Planned downtime is
          essential to ensure systems, applications and servers are up to date
          and functioning at optimal capacity. During scheduled downtime, IT
          professionals can also run tests to identify potential threats and fix
          them before they turn into real problems.
        </p>
        <p><span>What Are IT Maintenance Services? </span></p>
        <p>
          IT maintenance services is a blanket term that includes complete
          software and hardware maintenance support for your business computer
          system. That means making a complete record of all hardware and
          software that must be maintained for the system to function properly
          and optimally. In addition, you must take responsibility for
          performing any maintenance tasks the system requires to meet that
          goal.
        </p>
        <p><span>Why Do I Need IT Maintenance Services? </span></p>
        <p>
          Keeping a whole business’ IT system — both software and hardware —
          running smoothly is a big task, even if you are a relatively small
          company. If you run a large company, it can seem completely
          overwhelming. One solution, of course, is to hire in-house IT staff.
          However, this can become extremely expensive, especially in larger
          companies, and even IT staff can become overwhelmed if enough issues
          arrive. In addition, there is a shortage of qualified IT personnel in
          our country.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you hire a dedicated IT maintenance support company like NTP to
          handle your software and hardware maintenance, you shift the enormous
          burden of making sure your IT is working properly off your plate and
          onto ours, so you can concentrate on the performance of your current
          business. You don’t have to worry about what might happen wrong with
          your IT system. You will know we are monitoring everything and will
          take care of any problems as they arise. However, if you are looking
          for instant help 24x7x365, better have a look at our support offers
          below.
        </p>
        <p><span>⇨ Unplanned Downtime &#8678; </span></p>
        <p>
          Unplanned downtime, on the other hand, is unintentional, unanticipated
          and can occur at any time. This can be due to several reasons,
          including hardware or software failure, human error, malicious attacks
          or natural disasters. Since unplanned downtime is unexpected and
          occurs without warning, preventing it can be a challenge. Regardless
          of its causes, unplanned downtime can bring your business to a
          grinding halt. However, by implementing a well-established business
          continuity plan, you can minimize the impact of downtime to a large
          extent.
        </p>
        <p><span>What Are the Causes of Downtime? </span></p>
        <p>
          There are several causes of downtime. Some of the main causes are
          explained below:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Human Error: </span> Whether accidental or due to negligence,
          human error is one of the most common causes of unplanned downtime. An
          employee unintentionally deleting data or accidentally unplugging a
          cable or not following standard protocols can lead to costly downtime.
          Human error is unavoidable but with regular training and having a
          well-documented IT checklist or policies, its frequency can be
          reduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Hardware/Software Failure: </span> Obsolete hardware or software
          increases the chances of application failure and system outages.
          Outdated hardware and software also result in inefficient performance,
          which can have a significant impact on productivity. If patches are
          applied without proper testing, they can corrupt the entire
          application.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Device Misconfiguration: </span>Device misconfiguration is
          another major cause of unplanned downtime. Configuration errors can
          create security gaps in your network, making it vulnerable to
          cyberattacks. To avoid misconfiguration errors, you can automate the
          process instead of setting the parameters manually. Test the
          configurations in a lab setting before implementing the changes to
          your system.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span> Bugs: </span> Bugs in a server’s operating system can impact
          its performance as well as lead to security issues. If patches aren’t
          applied on time or applied without appropriate testing, they can
          corrupt applications and lead to server failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Cybersecurity Threats: </span> Cyberthreats, including
          sophisticated ransomware and phishing attacks, are one of the most
          dangerous and common causes of IT downtime, and can bring your
          organization to a standstill. Malicious actors can easily exploit
          vulnerabilities in your network, infiltrate systems and gain access to
          confidential data. Employee training and implementing security
          solutions, such as spam filters, multifactor authentication and file
          encryption, can contribute a long way towards overcoming cybersecurity
          challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span> Natural Disasters: </span>Natural disasters, such as
          hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, can disrupt power supply and
          communication or even damage hardware. This can have catastrophic
          consequences for your business if downtime extends for a prolonged
          period.
        </p>
        <p><span> Downtime Costs </span></p>
        <p>
          Downtime costs can vary depending on the size and nature of your
          business as well as the duration of downtime.
        </p>
        <p><span>Downtime Cost Calculator </span></p>
        <p>
          Knowing the cost of downtime will help you evaluate its impact on your
          business. Use the downtime calculator or follow the directions to
          calculate the true cost of downtime.

        </p>
        <p><span>Other Costs and Effects of Downtime </span></p>
        <p>
          Apart from financial losses, there are other consequences of downtime
          that organizations must deal with if unprepared. Depending on the
          frequency and extent of downtime, it can have both short- and
          long-term effects on your business. Listed below are some of the major
          consequences of downtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Lost Productivity:</span> When downtime due to equipment failure
          or network outage occurs, mission-critical systems become unavailable
          for use. Without essential applications, systems and network services,
          employees wouldn’t be able to do their work. As such, employees are
          involuntarily idle. The length of an unproductive period depends on
          the duration of the downtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Lost Business Opportunities: </span> In today’s interconnected
          digital world where businesses rely heavily on application uptime and
          availability, a moment of downtime can leave a negative impact on your
          business. Downtime can result in poor experiences, including your
          customers being unable to access your products or services. In
          addition, your employees are unable to support them since the
          necessary tools are out of order. Such instances can easily drive away
          existing clients as well as prospects.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Damaged Brand Image: </span>In this fast-paced business
          landscape, customers expect a quick, seamless experience every time.
          Delays are intolerable and downtime is unacceptable. In such a
          scenario, a single downtime event can put your organization’s
          reliability and reputation at risk. Repeated downtime events can
          result in unhappy customers, which can quickly translate into
          dissatisfied customer reviews and a tarnished brand image.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Data Loss: </span> Downtime affects not only your business but
          your clients as well. Downtime due to cyberattacks, server or network
          outages can result in corrupted, damaged or stolen data. Unexpected
          downtime, such as a server outage, can potentially expose your
          valuable data or create security gaps, which cybercriminals can
          exploit to gain unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <p><span> Downtime Monitoring and Prevention</span></p>
        <p>
          It is unpredictable and can happen to any organization, irrespective
          of its size. In the process of planning any project, we always develop
          disaster recovery plans and implement BCDR (Business continuity and
          disaster recovery) to minimise downtime impact on business.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what if you don’t have BCDR, you are already in the process of
          updating your existing infrastructure, network and applications? Or,
          you are not yet aware of what you should do or how you can maximise
          prevention?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't have a proper BCDR in place, there is a possibility of
          unexpected downtime. Do you know what to do if something goes horribly
          wrong? How can you keep your finger on the pulse 24/7? How long can
          you afford to be without your systems before it starts to affect your
          customers and therefore your business?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where NTP's support and maintenance service comes into play.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might know how to work with your company’s systems, but you will
          need our support and maintenance services that can reduce downtime
          risks, so that you can ensure your devices are up to date, test
          backups regularly, and constantly monitor your network and devices.
          Most connectivity problems can be fixed quickly by technical experts
          over the phone. Many can even be prevented before they occur through
          proactive monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if you are using software that comes with customer support, it
          can't help to have a local speaking dedicated IT support team on-hand
          that is familiar with your existing infrastructure and systems. They
          may be able to fix the issue for you faster than you can contact your
          software provider’s support team.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>
            A professional IT support team like us can analyse most technical
            problems and deliver highly skilled solutions.</span

        <p><span> Data Storage - Human Error</span></p>
        <p>
          NTP IT Support team's role is to make sure, in case of human error,
          your data is not deleted and, in case of attack, is stored in a secure
          environment and make sure it is easily accessible but only to the
          people that are allowed to view it. Without the support of a
          professional IT team, you could end up storing data in a vulnerable
          location. Or giving access to somebody without the right permission.
          This can be a big issue where data protection is concerned. In case of
          application, hardware or software failure, natural disaster or
          security misconfiguration, it is most critical to fix the issue asap.
          This will ensure that your business continues to operate without
          failure.

          escalation of technical departments, we can handle any technical task
          of any complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Cost - </span> By providing a suitable engineer according to the
          complexity of our customer's task, our company optimises both our
          resources and our customer's cost. Depending on the complexity of your
          requirements, the price of the service is commensurate with the
          quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span> Flexibility -</span> Long contracts may sound apathetic to our
          customers, especially to those who have never used our services
          before. In order to show customers the value of our services, we offer
          three-month, six-month, one-year and two-year contracts, and also
          provide the same pricing formulation per month for the same volume of
          SLA's as our three-month contract and two-year contract.
